# Lunar Shell

Lunar Shell (lush) is an open source unix shell with a single goal in mind. That goal is to offer the ability to write shell scripts for your operating system entirely in Lua. The Lua scripting language has many powerful features that allow for more control in the hands of the user to automate tasks on their machine.

## Compiling/Installation

Clone the repo and run the install script.

```
git clone https://github.com/BanceDev/lush.git
cd lush
sh install.sh
```

For future compiles just run ```make``` from the root directory. If you change the premake5.lua file rebuild the makefiles with ```premake5 gmake```.
